# PirateGame - Angular Port

> This branch is currently under active development. The original releases of pirate game were built using completely vanilla JS, CSS and HTML. Having improved understanding and experience since the original release, we are now porting the application over to the javascript framework known as Angular.

### Setup
In order to install the necessary libraries on your machine, first clone the repo. Navigate to its directory and then src-ui and run:
```npm i```

### Usage
Simply run ```ng serve``` from within the src-ui directory
