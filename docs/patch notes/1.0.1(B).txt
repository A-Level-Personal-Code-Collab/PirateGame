Version 1.0.1(B) - Safari Update
^Overview
~ Safari Update. After our previous update which introduced mobile support to the pirate game, we were pretty confident that the wind was in our sails for mobile piratein'. After deployment, it transpired Apple devices had been given the black spot and had not seen shore of these improvements. We roped in a few favours and got some apple devices to test on so you can sail on your lavish iPhone without needing an eye-patch on both eyes.
