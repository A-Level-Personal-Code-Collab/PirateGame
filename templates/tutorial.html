                <h3>Rules</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The Pirate Game is an activity where each person in the game, on their Pirate game
                worksheet, places a set of symbols and values in a 7 by 7 blank grid. The grid is
                labelled A-G across the columns and 1-7 down the rows. Therefore, you could place
                a 'shield' in A6, a '1000' in C4 etc etc.  The activity then starts with the youngest
                competitor selecting a grid reference, let’s say F1. Everyone then crosses off that
                grid reference and gets whatever symbol/value is in that grid reffernce. If they get a value
                they add this to their 'score' and this is kept as a running total throughout the game.
                If they get a symbol, there is a particular purpose to each of these and they need to
                act accordingly. Play continues in a clockwise direction (unless someone activates
                their Choose option – see below).
                Any of the actions listed can be adapted (or abandoned) according to the group size,
                age of players or personal preference.
                Oh, the winner is the player at the end of the activity that has the highest score when
                both their 'bank' and their ongoing score are combined.</p>

                                    to happen to the attacking player. i.e. if someone wanted to 'rob' me of my points and
