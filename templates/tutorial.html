                <h3>Rules</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The Pirate Game is an activity where each person in the game, on their Pirate game
                worksheet, places a set of symbols and values in a typically 6 by 6 blank grid. The grid is
                labelled A-F across the columns and 1-6 down the rows. Therefore, you could place
                a 'shield' in A6, a '1000' in C4 etc.  The activity then host presses next round. The system will cross of squares each turn. If they get cash
                the game will add this to their 'money' and this is kept as a running total throughout the game.
                If they get a symbol, there is a particular purpose to each of these and they need to
                act accordingly. 
                Any of the actions listed can be adapted (or abandoned) according to the group size,
                age of players or personal preference.
                Oh, the winner is the player at the end of the activity that has the highest amount of money when
                both their 'bank' and their ongoing money are combined.</p>

                                    to happen to the attacking player. i.e. if someone wanted to 'rob' me of my money and
                                    I used my mirror then I would 'rob' their money! Note: Using it on a 'swap' would be completely pointless!</p></td>
