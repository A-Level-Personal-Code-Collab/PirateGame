                <br>
                <p>The Pirate Game is an online multiplayer activity where each person in the game, on their own mobile device, places a set of symbols into a [typically] 6x6 blank grid. The grid is
                labelled A-F and 1-6 down. Therefore, you could, for example, place 'shield' in the square with reference A6, a '£1000 Note' in C4 etc. The host will then spin the spinner to move to the next round
                the game will add this to their 'money' and this is kept as a running total throughout the game.
                The square that has been chosen by the spinner will be indicated on your grid and the game will act according to the item placed within it. For example, a £1000 note will increase your cash while the 'kill' item will allow you to chose a an unfortunate target whose money will be reset to 0.
                The winner is the player at the end of the activity that has the highest amount of money when both their 'bank' and their ongoing money are combined.</p>
