            Myself (Will) and Adam began to consider the academic and practical benefits of doing a joint programming project so, after some deliberation
            regarding the exact nature of the project, we settled to try and recreate one of our favorite classroom games in an engauging digital format. 
            Since then, the project has snowballed to become what you see presented before you. Amidst the development, we welcomed Ollie into the team
            to bring the sum total of developers to 3. We must also dole our thanks to Charlie Kay (music) and Jack Hegarty (logo & art) whose creative abilities
            are orders of magnitude better what we three could have composed.
            <span class="br"></span>
            An unfortunate lesson to swallow was that the hosting required for the server does not come free but costs a recurring fee likewise does the URL.
            As you may have inferred, we're only just in our A-Level year and thus if you do enjoy the game that we been able to produce, we would be indebted
            for your generous support. Please though, feel no obligation as we do what we do out of pure passion and pleasure.<span class="br"></span>
            Our upmost thanks for so much as taking the time to view our website!

            <p class="about_text">Started as a passion project, the pirate game has its origins in the Summer of 2021 but has quickly
                become an ongoing project for the three of us. The project was originally developed as a way to improve our python and
                programming proficiency but also as a way to experience collaboration in programming - a key skill for future employment in the field.
                In fact, the project has not only acquainted us with GitHub as a collaboration tool, improved our repertoire of python syntaxes, introduced
                us to the web-space languages of HTML, CSS and JavaScript but also taught us about hosting sites and administering projects with Docker.
                <span class="br"></span> Through a coordination of many different languages, you are able to use your own device to send a request across the 
                wonderful internet which is handled and processed by our python code. The python code will package its response up to you and your computer
                will dutifully receive it and display what it receives. Once you have the response the work of the program is not done as we've had to write
                CSS style sheets that describe the colour, layout and design of the pages. Some complex operations like handling the selection of squares
                of dragging items into position also require your browser to do some heavy lifting; functionality that is provided by the page's JavaScript.<span class="br"></span>
                All of these different functionalities have had to be addressed in our programming and this is without even touching upon the database handling and
                docker environments. As you can imagine, its been many hundreds of hours of work but we couldn't have wished it any other way as we've been rewarded
                with the such a rich banquet of learning and enjoyment.</p>
