Version 0.1.0(B)
^Overview
~ You've spied yourself our first incremental update! This time, the majority of work has gone into making key changes below deck to keep the server shipshape. You'll also spot a few design changes including to the way cash is displayed in the online game and to the lobby background

^Patch notes pages
- Patch notes pages built on demand by the server for ease of writing (#141)
- Update Home page (index page) notes to contain the latest (#159)
- Updated patch page with new patch notes
- Patch notes overview now parsed from patch notes .txt files

^Sheet Builder
- Fixed bug where dropping items into the item bank causes them to be deleted (#152)
- Added functionality to drop items bank into the item bank

^Online Game
- Delayed display of spinner output (e.g. Cash update) now handled by client rather than server side delay (#151)
- Fixed bug where mirroring a kill would swap your cash with the other player's
- Increased available time to retaliate from 3s to 5s (#155)
- Personal actions like bomb and bank are shown in your private log
- Current bank and money value displayed instead of cumulative value list (#153)
- New font for 'Your Cash', 'Your Bank' and 'Game Log' titles (now matches the declare button)

^Back End
- Database location moved from sqlite in memory database to mariadb disk database for access across multiple scopes and machines (#143)
- Socketio functionality now handled by separate gameplay server. This runs as its own docker independently of the webserver with some shared resources (#142)
- Added default deletion time for games and users of 6 hours after creation to prevent accumulation (#146)
- Added functionality to automatically create required database tables when game server is started
- All pages receive version number from server instead of being defined in the html files

^Lobby
